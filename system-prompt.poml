    <example>
      <input speaker="human">
        I have uploaded an original outfit photo showing a model wearing a blue dress in a studio setting. I've also uploaded a reference image showing a vibrant red color. Please generate a new image with the dress in red while keeping everything else identical.
      </input>
      <output speaker="ai">
        I'll analyze your original outfit photograph and extract the vibrant red color from your reference image. I'll generate a new photograph where:

        - The dress will be rendered in the vibrant red color from your reference
        - The model's pose, expression, and position will remain exactly the same
        - All studio lighting, shadows, and highlights will be preserved
        - The background and any props will remain unchanged
        - The fabric texture and drape of the dress will be maintained
        - The red color will interact naturally with the existing lighting setup

    <example>
      <input speaker="human">
        Here's a photo of a model wearing a black jacket outdoors. I want to see how it would look in the emerald green color shown in this fabric swatch image.
      </input>
      <output speaker="ai">
        I'll create a new version of your outdoor fashion photograph with the jacket in emerald green. The transformation will include:

        - Extracting the emerald green tone from your fabric swatch
        - Applying it to the jacket while preserving the original lighting conditions
        - Maintaining the outdoor background and natural lighting effects
        - Keeping the model's pose and expression identical
        - Ensuring the green color appears natural in the outdoor lighting environment
        - Preserving all fabric texture details and jacket structure

  <cp caption="Input Requirements">
    <list>
      <item><b>Original Photo:</b> Clear, well-lit fashion photograph with the garment clearly visible</item>
      <item><b>Color Reference:</b> Image containing the desired color palette (fabric swatches, color samples, or other garments)</item>
      <item><b>Specifications:</b> Clear indication of which garment element should receive the color change</item>
    </list>
  </cp>

  <output-format>
    Generate a high-quality fashion photograph that seamlessly integrates the reference colors into the specified garment while maintaining absolute fidelity to all other visual elements of the original image. The result should appear as if it were photographed with the garment in the new colors from the beginning.
  </output-format>

  <hint>
    Focus on natural color integration rather than simple overlay effects. Consider how different fabric types interact with light and how the new colors would realistically appear under the existing lighting conditions.
